**~~~ DAY: 1 - February 17th, 2021 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
Currently coding Javascript daily on freecodecamp in order to refresh the basics and actually learn to code it on my own with it being familiar. I am also considering doing the python project on AWS. Also I’m taking a course on LinkedIn about JS for web designers to target what I’ll actually use JS for.

**Thoughts**
I actually think it’s funny that you can learn skills to do certain projects, but not learn what to do with the language outside of those particular projects. I’m learning the importance of habit and to keep the skills obtained, constant.

## Today's Progress:
I am now 60% through the basics of JS section. I have been reading Atomic Habits in hopes to getting at least 1% better each day at coding and be more organized with my time. I have been changing my stickershop branding, and with it, I bought a new domain and set up the email all within 30mins. I may think of a simple website design for it soon. I also made a new repo for these entries to make sure it shows up on my contributions.

**Thoughts**
Freecodecamp is honestly been the best way for me to re-learn and really understand Javascript. I sometimes re-type the entire problem instead of inserting the minimal answer into the code just to get used to the syntax.

## Today's Progress:
I progressed to 68% in JS on Freecodecamp and went through some on the LinkedIn course: Javascript for Web Designers

**Thoughts**
Still a little rusty with automaticially knowing what steps to perform with JS, but I see that I'm getting closer to the solutions than before.

**~~~ DAY: 4 - February 20, 2021 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
I've made progress with my voyage team with designing the project. I've also managed to write a blog post with all of my progress this year.

**Thoughts**
I'd love to create a react page for my stickers once I get a grip on JS. Also, I will be looking into AWS and ITIL certifications.

**~~~ DAY: 5 - February 21, 2021 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
I actually pulled and pushed to the Voyage team's repo with a good understanding of what's going on. I created a header on my branch without purposely pushing to the master branch so the team could get used to not working on the main/master. I am trucking along with JS at a good 72%.

**Thoughts**
 I'm actually getting even more closer to the correct answers with little to no assistance for the JS problems, and I'm super proud.
