*=============================*



**~~~ DAY: 1 - February 17th, 2021 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
Currently coding Javascript daily on freecodecamp in order to refresh the basics and actually learn to code it on my own with it being familiar. I am also considering doing the python project on AWS. Also I’m taking a course on LinkedIn about JS for web designers to target what I’ll actually use JS for.

**Thoughts**
I actually think it’s funny that you can learn skills to do certain projects, but not learn what to do with the language outside of those particular projects. I’m learning the importance of habit and to keep the skills obtained, constant.


**~~~ DAY: 2 - February 18th, 2021 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
I am now 60% through the basics of JS section. I have been reading Atomic Habits in hopes to getting at least 1% better each day at coding and be more organized with my time. I have been changing my stickershop branding, and with it, I bought a new domain and set up the email all within 30mins. I may think of a simple website design for it soon. I also made a new repo for these entries to make sure it shows up on my contributions.

**Thoughts**
Freecodecamp is honestly been the best way for me to re-learn and really understand Javascript. I sometimes re-type the entire problem instead of inserting the minimal answer into the code just to get used to the syntax. 

**~~~ DAY: 3 - February 19, 2021 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
I progressed to 68% in JS on Freecodecamp and went through some on the LinkedIn course: Javascript for Web Designers

**Thoughts**
Still a little rusty with automaticially knowing what steps to perform with JS, but I see that I'm getting closer to the solutions than before.

**~~~ DAY: 4 - February 20, 2021 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
I've made progress with my voyage team with designing the project. I've also managed to write a blog post with all of my progress this year.

**Thoughts**
I'd love to create a react page for my stickers once I get a grip on JS. Also, I will be looking into AWS and ITIL certifications.

**~~~ DAY: 5 - February 21, 2021 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
I actually pulled and pushed to the Voyage team's repo with a good understanding of what's going on. I created a header on my branch without purposely pushing to the master branch so the team could get used to not working on the main/master. I am trucking along with JS at a good 72%.

**Thoughts**
 I'm actually getting even more closer to the correct answers with little to no assistance for the JS problems, and I'm super proud.
 

 **~~~ DAY: 6 - February 22, 2021 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
After reading enough children’s books to visually understand Python further than just reading, I am ready and excited to piece my final project together that will showcase what I know, and what I want to explore (AWS). I started reading through the instructions of the set up for the project and will probably start it before the end of the week. 

**Thoughts**
I really do think it takes time to let concepts sink in, and it's something natural that can't be rushed. That’s what’s funny about learning; the content will stay the same, but your understanding of it, evolves. With Python in itself, I will re-iterate, that it just doesn’t interest me to continue with it unless sometime in the future, I find it useful for my career. I do see a React Note-Taking app, that I would love to showcase.

**~~~ DAY: 7 - February 23, 2021 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
I have been one-tract minding this JS course, and I’m up to 92%. Also, I scanned for jobs in search to find the well of jobs that actually look inviting to apply for. Hopefully, I can get in with a StartUp as my first position and the confidence that I'll gain from future projects, will cut my imposter syndrome off.

**Thoughts**
My first week into this again and I can say that it is an accomplishment. As a new habit, I can effectively reflect on what’s working and where improvement is needed. As I am learning more about the systems that make teams work together, I can apply certain aspects of them into my own personal life.
