**~~~ DAY: 1 - February 17th, 2020 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
Currently coding Javascript daily on freecodecamp in order to refresh the basics and actually learn to code it on my own with it being familiar. I am also considering doing the python project on AWS. Also I’m taking a course on LinkedIn about JS for web designers to target what I’ll actually use JS for.

**Thoughts**
I actually think it’s funny that you can learn skills to do certain projects, but not learn what to do with the language outside of those particular projects. I’m learning the importance of habit and to keep the skills obtained, constant.
