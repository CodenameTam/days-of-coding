*=============================*



**~~~ DAY: 1 - February 17th, 2021 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
Currently coding Javascript daily on freecodecamp in order to refresh the basics and actually learn to code it on my own with it being familiar. I am also considering doing the python project on AWS. Also I’m taking a course on LinkedIn about JS for web designers to target what I’ll actually use JS for.

**Thoughts**
I actually think it’s funny that you can learn skills to do certain projects, but not learn what to do with the language outside of those particular projects. I’m learning the importance of habit and to keep the skills obtained, constant.


**~~~ DAY: 2 - February 18th, 2021 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
I am now 60% through the basics of JS section. I have been reading Atomic Habits in hopes to getting at least 1% better each day at coding and be more organized with my time. I have been changing my stickershop branding, and with it, I bought a new domain and set up the email all within 30mins. I may think of a simple website design for it soon. I also made a new repo for these entries to make sure it shows up on my contributions.

**Thoughts**
Freecodecamp is honestly been the best way for me to re-learn and really understand Javascript. I sometimes re-type the entire problem instead of inserting the minimal answer into the code just to get used to the syntax. 

**~~~ DAY: 3 - February 19, 2021 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
I progressed to 68% in JS on Freecodecamp and went through some on the LinkedIn course: Javascript for Web Designers

**Thoughts**
Still a little rusty with automaticially knowing what steps to perform with JS, but I see that I'm getting closer to the solutions than before.

**~~~ DAY: 4 - February 20, 2021 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
I've made progress with my voyage team with designing the project. I've also managed to write a blog post with all of my progress this year.

**Thoughts**
I'd love to create a react page for my stickers once I get a grip on JS. Also, I will be looking into AWS and ITIL certifications.

**~~~ DAY: 5 - February 21, 2021 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
I actually pulled and pushed to the Voyage team's repo with a good understanding of what's going on. I created a header on my branch without purposely pushing to the master branch so the team could get used to not working on the main/master. I am trucking along with JS at a good 72%.

**Thoughts**
 I'm actually getting even more closer to the correct answers with little to no assistance for the JS problems, and I'm super proud.
 

 **~~~ DAY: 6 - February 22, 2021 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
After reading enough children’s books to visually understand Python further than just reading, I am ready and excited to piece my final project together that will showcase what I know, and what I want to explore (AWS). I started reading through the instructions of the set up for the project and will probably start it before the end of the week. 

**Thoughts**
I really do think it takes time to let concepts sink in, and it's something natural that can't be rushed. That’s what’s funny about learning; the content will stay the same, but your understanding of it, evolves. With Python in itself, I will re-iterate, that it just doesn’t interest me to continue with it unless sometime in the future, I find it useful for my career. I do see a React Note-Taking app, that I would love to showcase.

**~~~ DAY: 7 - February 23, 2021 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
I have been one-tract minding this JS course, and I’m up to 92%. Also, I scanned for jobs in search to find the well of jobs that actually look inviting to apply for. Hopefully, I can get in with a StartUp as my first position and the confidence that I'll gain from future projects, will cut my imposter syndrome off.

**Thoughts**
My first week into this again and I can say that it is an accomplishment. As a new habit, I can effectively reflect on what’s working and where improvement is needed. As I am learning more about the systems that make teams work together, I can apply certain aspects of them into my own personal life.

**~~~ DAY: 8 - February 24, 2021 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
Completed 2 more mini lessons on FCC making me at 96%. I had to take more time understanding these problems but, I eventually got the hang of it. Went to Women Who Code's Charlotte virtual event of coffee and chat.

**Thoughts**
I have taken a break from social media to fully understand JS. I really can't want to start making projects from it. However, I know pacing myself is key.

**~~~ DAY: 9 - February 25, 2021 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
Completed the JS Basics module. Drafted ways to design and code my sticker website for fun and addon to current projects.

**Thoughts**
I feel great that I completed the JS basics. I do feel like I still get confused on concepts, but I know with more practice, I'll become familiar and I'm looking forward to that. I really want to understand the why or "tools" outside of building projects that only teach what "tools" are only needed for that project. So I hope to equip myself with knowing what to do with JS in any given situation.

**~~~ DAY: 10 - February 26, 2021 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
Attended a webinar on an AWS certification for a Cloud Practitioner to get more insight on how to become certified. Worked more on my Python project with AWS. Started the ES6 module on FCC

**Thoughts**
I am really trying to focus on completing one thing at a time. It's so difficult not to have your hands in multiple courses, articles, projects, content, books, etc. at one time. So with keeping focus, I'll do my best to finish the current project and breaking with others. I really want to utilize being at home, and possibly making an online empire whether that's with content, website projects, or selling products.

**~~~ DAY: 11 - February 27, 2021 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
Set up my first static site on AWS for the project. Went over some JS with FCC and looked up the resources to exercise it again.

**Thoughts**
I think today was preting minimum, but nonetheless meaningful. I'm still feeling good about JS and ready to apple the knowledge. AWS is pretty complex with all of it's services and extras that the average person would be overwhelmed with. Thankful for the tutorials.

**~~~ DAY: 12 - February 28, 2021 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
Continued the FCC and AWS. 

**Thoughts**
I wanted to make today count by putting in some code time before I dozed off to sleep. I just got the greenlight that daycare will be free for another 2mo. giving me the advantage of getting a job from home.

**~~~ DAY: 13 - March 1, 2021 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
I continued my project on AWS, and almost finished it but I literally got frustrated because it was mainly about setting up the backend and piecing up the “plug-and-play” information for the front-end, not actually building it. However I do see how intricate AWS is now and for ones that are passionate about backend, that would’ve been fun. But honestly I was understanding it but once something is plugged in wrong, the whole thing can break. So I simply googled python projects (that didn’t involve importing modules) to showcase in my browser for my final project.

**Thoughts**
I'm ready to be done with Python as a whole. I know that while I try to have an interest for it, I'm even more eager to get back to web development. Not programming. 

**~~~ DAY: 14 - March 2, 2021 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
Attended the fellowship event about GIT. I asked the question about public repos and “secrets” and “env’s” and the host, had gotten little flustered about diving into the answer, ended up revealing is own computer secrets on accident to further explain. 

I found a project from my Udemy course that could be presented just to simplify the process of finalizing the fellowship.


**Thoughts**
It ended up being an advanced answer/topic, therefore I felt as though it had taken away from the other fellows as maybe something they didn’t understand yet. However, when explaining git to a beginner, I do feel like it was an important topic that maybe could be mentioned, and it’s an honest issue to have with GIT, but maybe not for that particular lecture.

In the process of finding a simple project with no modules, my love/hate relationship with Python continues. Ultimately, I wanted to understand exactly what part “programming” plays in a world of front-end and I’m still content on front and backend development with Javascript. But thinking of programming, makes me cringe thinking of the misery.

**~~~ DAY: 15 - March 3, 2021 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
Gathered the resources I needed to present something nice. Also figuring out what technologies will be the most convenient.

**Thoughts**
I’m finding that if a time takes too long to complete, there is a shorter way to go about it if you know where to look. I ended up just using the original program on Repl.It and not a live server due to putting in a time for it to run

**~~~ DAY: 16 - March 4, 2021 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
Created presentation and form of Demonstrating

**Thoughts**
I am getting so used to my own execution method of not waiting until the last minute, but maybe the last day. I do perform better with pressure and I know the time it takes something, to give myself that “almost” last minute time. I literally did the presentation (from hunting down a good design), googled how to mirror my phone, made sure the details were detailed, for everything to run smoothly. 

The actual presenting was basically everyone observing how you present, what’s on their screen, and how you’re handling your nerves (whether they cared about the actual project is unknown lol). I know I wanted to impress with the presentation itself, hit my speaking points, get it working, and not extend the attention spans of the audience.

**~~~ DAY: 17 - March 5, 2021 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
Started the Take Home Test, Talked to my mentor
**Thoughts**
Designing the code was pretty challenging but the fact that you have to break it down to a computer is what helps you break the problem down. So I’ve spent most of the day researching, going through my coding books and finding what applies to this project, given I haven’t used some of these elements in a while.

Now that the fellowship has ended, my mentor gladly extended an invitation to continue meeting/talking and I couldn’t be happier. Our talk today was thorough as always, and he even helped me with the group project. He is at a sensei level of resourceful, and I do understand that it’s what coding needs. He complimented me on my presentation design and demo so I’m an excited mentee. I feel like a chick that has hatched and ready to leave the nest and show what I’ve got from the “nourishment” from how this has helped me. Tech is getting simpler by the day in terms of what it takes.

**~~~ DAY: 18 - March 6, 2021 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
Finished the Take Home Test and submitted my first a pull request.

**Thoughts**
Whether I even get considered for the position or not, I’m so proud of myself that I completed this project. I’ve discovered so much with my work flow, digging for answers, and creating a seamless project. Github is such an interesting place and it makes me excited how expansive the entire web is. The project was tough. I used ES6 and now want to learn more. So I will continue with my FCC module. I had so much fun with the styling and to get it perfect, along with the code itself. It is really what I love to do.

**~~~ DAY: 19 - March 7, 2021 ~~~**

## Today's Progress:
Continue with both the LinkedIn Course Freecodecamp to explore more of ES6. Focus more on it during the week.

**Thoughts**
I’m super excited to feel actually comfortable about learning now and not pressured. I’m seeing that the time it takes to truly get familiar, is vital. So is the habit of practicing. Finishing up the Voyage and thinking about another one or applying to Collab Lab. I really love collaborating and using GitHub in this way. I’ll be planning my week to get some more things done.
